# Project Introduction

## Organization

Merideum-kotlin is organized into many modules:

* `core`: parent module for all code that can be run directly. Should not contain any framework specific code.
    * `antlr`: module for code that is autogenerated by ANTLR4 based off the grammar files. This module should not be
      modified directly.
    * `api`: the api for running a Merideum script.
    * `interpreter`: the implementation of the ANTLR4 interpreter.
* `ktor`: code specific for running Merideum using the Ktor web framework or accessing a Merideum api.
    * `server`: code for instantiating a Merideum api in Ktor. Includes a Ktor Plugin for easy usage.
* `examples`: a series of examples using Merideum in Kotlin.

Adding another web framework implementation (Spring or Micronaut, etc.) should be as easy as creating a new module for
that framework.

## Dependency Management

The project should seek to update dependency versions when immediately available to avoid falling behind.

Kotlin and Gradle versions will be updated immediately. Java versions will updated when a new LTS is available.
